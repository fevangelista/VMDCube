    "This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates how to use the VMDCube package to visualize a cube file in 3D using VMD (Visual Molecular Dynamics). The example assumes you have VMD installed and available in your system's PATH.\n",

    "To run this example you will need to have VMD installed and available in your system's PATH.\n",
    "- You can download VMD from the official website: [VMD Download](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/). Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.\n",
    "- Make sure to set the `VMDPATH` variable to the path where VMD is installed on your system. For example, if VMD is installed in `/usr/local/bin/vmd`, set `VMDPATH` to `/usr/local/bin/vmd`."
